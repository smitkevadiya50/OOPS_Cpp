# C++ OOP Concepts Examples

## Overview
This repository contains four key projects demonstrating the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. Each project provides practical examples to understand these concepts better.

## Projects

### 1. Abstraction
- **File:** `Abstraction.cpp`
- **Description:** This project demonstrates the concept of Abstraction in C++. Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary functionalities to the user.

### 2. Encapsulation
- **File:** `Encapsulation.cpp`
- **Description:** The Encapsulation example encapsulates the data (variables) and the code (functions) in a single unit called class in C++. This project illustrates how Encapsulation can be used to hide the internal representation of an object.

### 3. Inheritance
- **File:** `Inheritance.cpp`
- **Description:** This example showcases Inheritance, a mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class. The Inheritance project in C++ demonstrates how properties and behaviors can be inherited from parent classes.

### 4. Polymorphism
- **File:** `Polymorphism.cpp`
- **Description:** The Polymorphism project provides an example of how objects can be manipulated through their pointer or reference types, demonstrating both compile-time (static) and run-time (dynamic) polymorphism.

## Getting Started
To run these examples, you will need a C++ compiler. You can compile each file individually using a command-line interface.

Example:
```bash
g++ -o Abstraction Abstraction.cpp
./Abstraction
```
